# STEMCraft Player Commands

This plugin enables certain commands which modify the time and weather for a specific player only. Key features include:

- **Setting The Time And Weather For A Specific Player**: Players and admins can modify the time of day for themselves or other people, allowing for adapting creative builds for any lighting conditions, or filmmaking.
- **No Mob Spawning Or Other Effects**: Since the time and weather is only set for the player - no other effects, such as mob spawning or lightning, will occur (except if the player time and/or weather matches the server time and/or weather).

## Commands

### /playerweather
The /playerweather (and its aliases) will set the player weather of a player.

#### Usage
/playerweather [type] [player]

/pweather [type] [player]

#### Arguments
type (required): Can be "reset", "clear", "rain", or "lookup".
- reset: Resynchronises the player weather with the server weather.
- clear, rain: Sets the player weather to "clear", or "rain", respectively.
- lookup: Gets the current set player weather.

player (optional): The name of the player whose player weather is to be changed. If not specified, it changes your own weather.

#### Behavior
- If no player is specified, the command sets the player weather of whoever ran the command.
- If a player is specified, the command sets the player weather of the player specified.
- When run from the console, a player name must be provided.

#### Permission
Requires the `stemcraft.pweather` permission to use this command. Using it on other players requires the `stemcraft.pweather.other` permission.
